# TreeSolve
This code provides a number of solvers for fluid-flow problems through a tree structure such as the pulmonary vessels.
Normally solving these kinds of problems is computationally very difficult - solving the full 3D Navier-Stokes equations on a system as complex as the pulmonary blood vessels is not tractable on current computaitonal resources.
So all modelling software - including commercial solvers - make simplifications to the geometry and the mathematics in order to make these problems solvable.

The purpose of this software is to help investigate the effects of varying different parameters on the model solutions.
